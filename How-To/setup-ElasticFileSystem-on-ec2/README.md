# Create Amazon EFS File System and Mount It on an EC2 Instance

Amazon EFS provides elastic, shared file storage that is **POSIX-compliant**. The file system you create supports concurrent read and write access from multiple Amazon EC2 instances and is accessible from all of the Availability Zones in the AWS Region where it is created.

You can mount an Amazon EFS file system on EC2 instances in your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) using the Network File System version 4.1 protocol (NFSv4.1).
